# **PetFriends**

[RESPONSIVE SCREENSHOT]

This is a website for pets only! We have here a social media for pets. We can make our beloved pets a profile so they can post silly photos of themselves and follow, vote (or downvote) and comment on other pet's profiles! Saving posts is even possible. All pets welcome! From cats, dogs, hedgehogs, lizards and so on. The site is a content sharing platform, which, once you sign up, you will be redirected to sign in and then redirected to the home page/main feed. From there you can click on your profile icon in the top right of the NavBar and see your profile stats (once you gain some), see your posts, and click on the bars to edit your profile, password and username. Personalise your pet's profile with a picture and a bio, a little bit about your pet!

Once your pet follows a few profiles, you'll be able to see said followed profiles in the "pawfeed" section from the NavBar. The NavBar also contains a "saved" section, which allows you to see posts that you (your pets) specifically saved.

There is a sidebar featured on the posts and profile pages, to show the popular pets profiles and suggested "recommended users to follow". 

Once you're on the homepage, you can "add post", you can also use the search bar above the "add post" section to search through all posts using a keyword or a user's name. 
The three dots on the side of your post allow you to edit or delete your own posts, and the same goes for comments you've written on posts.

This project is the final of five projects that needs to be completed in order to receve a diploma in Software Development from The Code Institute.
